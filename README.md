As a **user**, I want to be able to:
- Add fish to a Tank
- Remove fish from a Tank
- Feed the fish
- Watch the fish swim around
- Check the hunger levels of the fish

If I have the time, I would love to add extra functionalities like:
- Being able to chase or "pet" fish with the cursor
- Providing basic animations for the fish
- Provide some decorations to drag and drop
- Having dirtiness accumulate + cleaning of the tank
- Provide code for the fish to "eat" the food and swim towards it
- Provide avenues to customize the tank and the background
- Provide avenues to customize the fish
- Have fish express their level of "contentment"
- Have fish die if too unhappy (? maybe I don't want this ?)
- Some degree of gamification where upgrades can be purchased, like an automatic feeder?
