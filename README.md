**A place where fish can be themselves!**

## User Stories
___

> a relaxing backdrop to provide a peaceful visual to the user.

### Who will use it?

> the joys of raising fish without the associated havoc!

### Why is the project of interest to you?

> Companionship and company is very valuable to me, and fish

# As a **user**, I want to be able to:
- Add fish to a Tank with chosen attributes of Name, Colour, Species
- Remove fish from a Tank
- Feed the fish to reset their hunger levels
- Watch the fish swim around
- Check the hunger levels of the fish
- Have the tank auto-save when I decide to quit the application
- When starting the application, have the option to either continue with the previous tank, or start over

# If I have the time, I would love to add extra functionalities like:
- Being able to "chase" fish with the cursor
- Providing basic animations for the fish
- Provide some decorations to drag and drop around the tank
- Having dirtiness accumulate + cleaning of the tank
- Provide code for the fish to "eat" the food and swim towards it
- Provide avenues to customize the tank and the background
- Provide avenues to customize the fish
- Have fish express their level of "contentment"
- Have fish die if too unhappy
- Some degree of gamification where upgrades can be purchased, like an automatic feeder
- Have fish interact with each other i.e. Prey fish gather in schools away from predators
